# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple browser implementation of the
classic [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game.
As per the [Project: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) lesson in The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.
The goal of this project was to make use of factory functions and modular JS,
and using as few global variables as possible, to make this program.
